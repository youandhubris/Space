Experiment in [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) with [ofxPostProcessing](https://github.com/neilmendoza/ofxPostProcessing), ofxKinect and ofxOsc (both included on the openFrameworks release) connected to [IanniX](http://www.iannix.org), for live performance.   The Kinect controls the *satellites* position, the sound controls the brightness and IanniX controls the camera position. (With no video capture, the frame rate is around 30.)  

Dark dark space. Play it, as loud as you can.  

A huge thanks to Mika Vainio, for letting me use his track.
Music by [Ø / Mika Vainio](http://mikavainio.com): "Monneista viimeinen / Last of Catfishes" from the album "Kantamoinen", 2005. [Sähkö Recordings](http://sahkorecordings.com) ·  [Boomkat](http://boomkat.com/search?q=Artist%3A%20MIKA%20VAINIO&fields[]=artist,track_artists)
